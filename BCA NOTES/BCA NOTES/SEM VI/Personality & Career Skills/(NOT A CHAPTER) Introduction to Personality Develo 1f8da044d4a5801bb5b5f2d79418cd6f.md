    - **Infancy: Basic Trust vs. Mistrust**
        - Age: 0–1.5 years
        - Focus: The infant depends on caregivers for love, safety, and care.
        - Outcome: If care is consistent and nurturing, the child develops **trust**. If neglected or treated harshly, **mistrust** develops, leading to insecurity and fear in future relationships.
    - **Childhood: Initiative, Autonomy, and Industry**
        - Age: 1.5–12 years (includes multiple sub-stages)
        - **Autonomy vs. Shame & Doubt (1.5–3 yrs)**: Child begins to assert independence (e.g., toilet training). Encouragement fosters autonomy, while criticism creates shame.
        - **Initiative vs. Guilt (3–5 yrs)**: Child explores and takes initiative in activities. Success leads to confidence; overcontrol or discouragement causes guilt.
        - **Industry vs. Inferiority (6–12 yrs)**: School years. Children develop work habits and skills. Praise encourages a sense of industry; constant failure leads to inferiority.
    - **Adolescence: Identity vs. Role Confusion**
        - Age: 12–18 years
        - Focus: Developing a personal identity (e.g., “Who am I?”). Adolescents explore roles, beliefs, and goals.
        - Outcome: Clear identity forms with self-confidence. Failure to resolve identity leads to **role confusion**, insecurity, and lack of direction.
    - **Adulthood: Intimacy, Generativity, and Integrity**
        - **Intimacy vs. Isolation (Young adulthood)**: Involves forming deep, meaningful relationships. Success leads to love and companionship. Failure causes isolation.
        - **Generativity vs. Stagnation (Middle age)**: Focus is on contributing to society and helping the next generation. Success brings fulfillment; failure results in stagnation.
        - **Integrity vs. Despair (Old age)**: Reflection on life. Those who feel accomplished develop a sense of integrity. Those with regret may feel despair
