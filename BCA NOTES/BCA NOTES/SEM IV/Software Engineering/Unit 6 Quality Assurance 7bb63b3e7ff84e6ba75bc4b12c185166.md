### Quality Standards

- Establishing standards and procedures for software development is critical, since these provide the framework from which the software evolves.
- Documentation Standards specify form and content for planning, control, and product
documentation and provide consistency throughout a project.
- Code Standards specify the language in which the code is to be written and define any restrictions on use of language features. They describe legal language structures, style conventions, rules for data structures and interfaces, and internal code documentation.

### Checklist

- A check sheet (also called a checklist or tally sheet) of events or occurrences is a form used to gather and record data in an organized manner. This tool records the number of occurrences over a specified interval of time to determine the frequency of an event. The data is recorded to support or objectively validate the significance of the event.
- To use a check sheet:
1. Clarify what must be collected objectively.
2. Establish a format for the data collection that is easily understood by the collector.
3. Ensure those involved understand the objectives so the collection process is accurate.
4. Establish the sample size and time frame of data collection.
5. Instruct or train data collectors for consistency.
6. Observe, record, and collect data.
7. Tally the results.
8. Depending on the purpose, build a Pareto chart or histogram or evaluate the results to
determine whether the original analysis is supported.
