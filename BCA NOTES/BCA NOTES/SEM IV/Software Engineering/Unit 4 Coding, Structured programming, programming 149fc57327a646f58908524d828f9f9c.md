# Unit 4 : Coding, Structured programming,  programming practices

### Logic

- Logic is the study of the principles of valid demonstration and inference. Logic is a branch of philosophy. Logic is also commonly used today in argumentation theory.

### Algorithm Design

- An algorithm design is **a process that involves creating a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions for a computer to follow while performing a task or solving a problem**.
- This process involves a series of steps, including problem analysis, requirements gathering, algorithm design, and implementation.

### Design walk through

- The walkthrough is a review meeting process but it is different from the  Inspection, as it does not involve any formal process i.e. it is a non-formal process. Basically, the walkthrough [review meeting process] is started by the Author of the code.
- In the walkthrough, the code or document is read by the author, and others who are present in the meeting can note down the important points or can write notes on the defects and can give suggestions about them.
- The walkthrough is an informal way of testing, no formal authority is been involved in this testing.
- As there is an informal way of testing involved so there is no need for a moderator while performing a walkthrough.
- We can call a walkthrough an open-ended discussion, it does not focus on the documentation. Defect tracking is one of the challenging tasks in the walkthrough.

### Critical Design Review

- At the critical design review (CDR), in nutshell, the detailed design is examined to determine whether levels of detail and completeness are sufficient for coding to begin.
- The detailed design phase culminates in the CDR.
- This review is attended by the development team and its managers, the requirements definition team and its quality assurance representatives, managers, user representatives, the CCB (Change Control Board), and other stake holders of the system.
