# Unit 5 : Software Testing & Maintenance

### Testing Strategies

1. **Black box testing** – Tests the functionality of the software without looking at the internal code structure.
2. **White box testing** – Tests the internal code structure and logic of the software.
3. **Unit testing** – Tests individual units or components of the software to ensure they are functioning as intended.
4. **Integration testing** – Tests the integration of different components of the software to ensure they work together as a system.
5. **Functional testing** – Tests the functional requirements of the software to ensure they are met.
6. **System testing** – Tests the complete software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements.
7. **Acceptance testing** – Tests the software to ensure it meets the customer’s or end-user’s expectations.
8. **Regression testing** – Tests the software after changes or modifications have been made to ensure the changes have not introduced new defects.
9. **Performance testing** – Tests the software to determine its performance characteristics such as speed, scalability, and stability.
10. **Security testing** – Tests the software to identify vulnerabilities and ensure it meets security requirements.

### Testing Tools

- **HP WinRunner**

– Reduce testing time by automating repetitive tasks and optimizing testing efforts

– Optimized testing efforts by covering diverse environments with a single testing tool

– Maximized return on investment through modifying and reusing test scripts as the application evolves

– Reduced testing time by automating repetitive tasks

- IBM Rational Robot
    - BM Rational Robot was **another popular record-and-playback tool that emerged in the 1990s**. Rational Robot was designed to automate testing for Windows-based applications and allowed testers to create automated test scripts by recording their interactions with a software application.
- Borland Segue Micro Focus Silk Test
    - **Silk Test** is a tool for automated function and regression testing of enterprise applications.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Test#cite_note-1) It was originally developed by [Segue Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segue_Software) which was acquired by [Borland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland) in 2006. Borland was acquired by [Micro Focus International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Focus_International) in 2009 and Micro Focus was later acquired by [OpenText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenText) in 2023. The original name for the product from 1993 through 1996 was **QA Partner**.

### Maintenance

- Although software does not show aging or wear and tear with use, with upcoming advanced
technologies and changing user requirements, software products get outdated or fail to support the changes in their environment for different reasons.
- Maintenance can only happen efficiently if the earlier phases are done properly. There are
four major problems that can slow down the maintenance process: unstructured code, maintenance programmers having insufficient knowledge of the system, documentation not available, out of date, or at best insufficient, and software maintenance having a bad image.
