# Unit 7 : Software Configuration Management

### Software Change Management

- Software Configuration Management, also known as Change Control Management.
- Change Management in software development refers to the transition from an existing state of the software product to another improved state of the product.
- It controls, supports, and manages changes to artifacts, such as code changes, process changes, or documentation changes.
- Each software development process follows Software Development Life Cycle where each phase is accordingly followed to finally deliver a good quality software product. Change Management does not come under any phases of SDLC still it has great importance in the entire software development process.

### Software Configuration Management

- **System Configuration Management (SCM)** is an arrangement of exercises that controls change by recognizing the items for change, setting up connections between those things, making/characterizing instruments for overseeing diverse variants, controlling the changes being executed in the current framework, inspecting and revealing/reporting on the changes made.
- Processes involved in SCM :
    - **Identification and Establishment**
    - **Version Control**
    - **Change Control**
    - **Configuration auditing**
    - **Reporting**

### Change Control

- Several procedures are necessary to maintain control over program changes.
    - The nature of the proposed change should be explained in writing, and formally approved by a responsible individual.
    - Major changes should be approved by the systems-planning steering committee, commonly called the CCB or Configuration Control Board, in the same manner as for new systems.
    - Minor changes may only require the joint approval of the IT manager and senior personnel in the user department.
    - Documenting the proposed change clears up any initial misunderstanding that may arise when only verbal requests are made.
    - Developers should make the program changes, not the operation group. Any change should be supported by adequate system documentation.
    - If the operators were authorized to make minor changes, it would greatly increase the difficulty of controlling versions and of maintaining up-to-date documentation.
    - Someone independent of the person who designed and made the change should be responsible for testing the final revised program.
    - The results should be recorded on program change registers and sent to the IT manager for approval. Operations should accept only properly approved changes.
    - Finally, the documentation system should be updated with all change sheets or change registers and printouts.
