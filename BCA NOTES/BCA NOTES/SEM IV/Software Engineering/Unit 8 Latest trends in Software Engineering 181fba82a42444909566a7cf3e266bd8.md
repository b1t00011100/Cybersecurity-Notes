# Unit 8 : Latest trends in Software Engineering

### Web SE

- The World Wide Web has become a major delivery platform for a variety of complex and sophisticated enterprise applications in several domains.
- Web Engineering is budding discipline which actively promotes systematic, quantifiable and disciplined approaches for successful creation of good quality, applications based on Web for everybody‘s use.
- Web engineering is neither a replica nor a part of software engineering, even if both involve programming and software development. While Web Engineering uses software engineering principles, it encompasses new approaches, methodologies, tools, techniques, and guidelines to meet the unique requirements of Web-based applications.
- **CASE TOOLS**
    - **Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE)**, in the field of Software Engineering is the scientific application of a set of tools and methods to software which is meant to result in high-quality, defect-free, and maintainable software work products. CASE tools refer to methods for the development of information systems among automated tools that can be used in the software development process.
    - The "Computer-aided software engineering" (CASE) is used for the automated development of systems software
    - Two key ideas of Computer Aided Software Engineering are :
        - The harboring of computer assistance in software development and or software maintenance processes, and
        - An engineering approach to the software development and or maintenance.
    - Some typical CASE tools are :
        - Configuration management tools
        - Data modeling tools
        - Model transformation tools
        - Program transformation tools
        - Refactoring tools
        - Source code generation tools, and
        - Unified Modeling Language

### Agile Programming

- Agile software development processes are built on the foundation of iterative development.
- Agile processes use feedback, rather than planning, as their primary control mechanism. The feedback is driven by regular tests and releases of the evolving software.
- There are many specific agile development methods. Most promote development iterations, teamwork, collaboration, and process adaptability throughout the life-cycle of the project
- Agile methods break tasks into small increments with minimal planning, and don‘t directly involve long-term planning. Iterations are short time boxes that typically last from 1 week to 4 weeks. All iteration involves a team working through a full software development cycle including planning, requirements analysis, design, coding, unit testing, and acceptance testing when a working product is demonstrated to stakeholders.
- This helps minimize overall risk, and lets the project adapt to
modification rapidly. Stakeholders produce documentation as required. Iteration may not add
enough functionality to warrant a market release, but the goal is to have an available release (with
minimal bugs) at the end of each, iteration. Multiple iterations may be required to release a product or new features.
- Agile methods emphasize face-to-face communication over written documents when the team is all in the same location
- Team size is 5 to 9 members to help make team communication and team collaboration easier.
- Specific tools and techniques such as continuous integration, automated or xUnit test, pair
programming, test driven development, design patterns, domain-driven design, code refactoring and other techniques are often used to improve quality and enhance project agility.

### XP : Extreme Programming

- Extreme Programming (XP) is a software engineering methodology which is intended to improve
software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements. As a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in small development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and launch checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted.

💡 Note :

"Extreme Programming Explained" describes Extreme Programming as a software development regulation that organizes people to create high quality software more productively.

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

- The UML is a standard language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as for business modeling and other non-software systems.
- The primary goals in the design of the UML were :
    - Provide users with a ready-to-use, meaningful visual modeling language so they can develop and exchange meaningful models.
    - Provide extensibility and specialization mechanisms to extend the core concepts.
    - Be independent of particular programming languages and development processes.
    - Encourage the growth of the object oriented tools market.
    - Support higher-level-development concepts such as collaborations, framework, patterns and components.
    - Integrate best practices.

### OOAD

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) is a software engineering methodology that employs object-oriented principles to model and design complex systems. It involves analyzing the problem domain, representing it using objects and their interactions, and then designing a modular and scalable solution. It helps create systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and extend by organizing functionality into reusable and interconnected components.
