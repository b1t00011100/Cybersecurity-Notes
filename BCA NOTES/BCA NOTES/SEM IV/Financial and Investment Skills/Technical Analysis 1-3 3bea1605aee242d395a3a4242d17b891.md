    a)  All the information about the company’s performance and prospects are contained in
    historical price and volume data
    
    b)  Market discounts everything in advance and hence the market behavior in terms of
    price and volume has reflected future news.
    
    c)  price moves in a trendy manner
    
    d)  history keeps repeating itself
    

### Types of Chart

- Some popular varieties of Charts used by analysts are
1. Line Chart : It shows Closing price against Date. It does not exhibit how the price fluctuated within day.
2. Bar Chart : A bar represents total price fluctuation from low tom high every day with ticks indicating open and close.
3. Candlestick Chart : Japanese candlestick chart is an improvisation of bar chart in the sense that in addition to Open, High, Low and Close price it also provides whether price has increased/decreased during the day.
    - A bar is replaced by a candle, it is shown as hollow
    or white (or green) if the price has increased and as solid or black (or red) if the price
    has decreased.
