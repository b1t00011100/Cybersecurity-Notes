# Introduction to Stock Market - 2

- A stock market is a market where:
    - Companies issue new securities
    - Investors trade on existing securities
- The basic requirement for a share to get traded on is to have a price quotation.
- This price quotation on an exchange is determined by demand and supply.
- The stock exchange provides secondary market.
- When the shares are being issued to the public through a public offering (called primary market), the price is determined by the company.
- Since the investors expect return on their investment, they will only buy the share or not sell their holding, if and only if they consider the profile of the company in good fashion and there is potential for appreciation.
- Why do Share price change :
    - Share prices keep changing due to demand and supply. The causes of demand and supply
    are because of :
        - Need to invest/disinvest
        - Varying view about the future outlook
        - Arrival of new information and its interpretation
- After owning a share, you will be entitled to benefits like dividends, bonus shares, voting rights etc.
- A standard measure to describe the level of return that a stock has offered is Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).
