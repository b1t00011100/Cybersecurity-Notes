### Clearing and Settlement Process

- The clearing and settlement process of a trade is not really useful for normal investors as there are intermediaries who take care of this.
- **NSCCL** : **National Securities Clearing Corporation Limited**
- NSCCL carries out clearing and settlement functions as per the settlement cycles provided in the settlement schedule.
- Settlement is a two way process which involves transfer of funds and securities on the settlement date
- Clearing is the process of determination of obligations, after which the obligations are discharged by settlement.
- NSCCL has two categories of clearing members: trading clearing members and custodians.
    - Trading members can trade on a proprietary basis or trade for their clients.
    - All proprietary trades become the member’s obligation for settlement.
    - Where trading members trade on behalf of their clients they could trade for normal clients or for clients who would be settling through their custodians.
    - Trades which are for settlement by Custodians are indicated with a Custodian Participant (CP) code and the same is subject to confirmation by the respective Custodian.

### Five Corporate Actions and Their Impact on Stock Prices

- **Dividend :** Dividends can be understood as a reward given by a company to its shareholders for investing their money.
    - They are expressed as percentage of the face value of a share or as an absolute amount per share.
    - If the dividend is paid during the financial year, it is known as interim dividend and if it is paid at the end of the year, it is known as final dividend.
- **Bonus Shares :** A bonus issue of shares means some shares are given away free to the existing shareholders. Bonus share issue is in the proportion of holding of shares.
    - Explanation
        
        Issue of bonus shares is a result of capitalizing the reserve. When shares become ex-
        bonus, the share price gets adjusted so that total value of share after bonus become
        almost same as what it was before. Suppose Kartikeya is holding 1200 shares of a
        company having market price of Rs. 300 per share. If the company gives bonus shares
        in the ratio 1:2, then after issue of ½*1200 = 600 bonus shares his holding will increase
        to 1800 shares and price per share fall to (2*300 + 1*0)/300 =200 per share. As a result, the total value of  shares will continue to be Rs. 360,000 [=1200*300=1800*200].
        
- **Splitting of Shares :** A stock split implies that the number of stocks in the holding increases but the value of the investment remains the same.
    - If a share with face value of Rs. 10 is split into five shares of Rs. 2 each, the share price will fall to one-fifth. However, with this the share will look very cheap and the demand shall increase significantly taking price upwards.
- **Right Shares :** The existing shareholders have the first right to subscribe to the shares that a company may be wanting to issue for raising capital.
    - If approved by shareholders, they are offered new shares in proportion of their holding. This type of issue is known as rights issue.
    - An individual shareholder may subscribe for all or some of the rights or may decline the issue. This will obviously affect his holding ratio.
- **Buyback of Shares :** Buyback of shares refers to the company purchasing the shares from the investors at a price which is higher than the prevailing market price.
    - There are restrictions on the upside by regulators.
    - Buyback of shares is a better alternative to dividend payout because of tax treatment.
