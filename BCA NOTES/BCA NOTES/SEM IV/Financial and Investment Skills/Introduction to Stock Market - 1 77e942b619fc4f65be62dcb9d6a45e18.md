## Investment Options

### Fixed Interest Securities

- A fixed-interest security is **a** debt investment such as a bond, debenture, or gilt-edged bond that investors use to loan money to a company in exchange for interest payments
- A fixed-interest security pays a specified rate of interest that does not change over the life of the instrument.
- Government bills: They are short-dated securities issued by governments to fund their short-term spending requirements. They are issued at a discount and redeemed at par with no coupon. They are often highly marketable and secure.
- There are two types of government bonds: fixed interest bonds which provide payments
that are fixed in monetary terms, and index-linked bonds which provide payments that
increase in line with changes in an inflation index.
- Debentures are loans that are secured on some or all of the assets of the company.

### Variable Return Assets

- **Equity Investment :** Equity shares are the common type of share capital. They give rights to a share of the residual profits of the company, and to the residual capital value if the company is  wound up, together with voting rights and various other rights.

    - The investor is rewarded by payment of dividend by the company or by making a capital gain at the time of selling at a higher price. The profit in terms of capital gains may attract a lower tax rate than other income.
- **Gold :** Gold is yet another popular investment option. In India, for centuries gold holding was treated as a barometer of wealth, thanks to social and cultural values.
    - Gold is regularly purchased on various occasions like child birth, marriage, wedding anniversary, birth day, and festivals like Dusshehra, Dhanteras, etc. Also, gifting of gold within family is considered auspicious and is an integral part of celebrations.
    - The price of Gold is largely determined by supply and demand and because of its limited supply, prices tend to rise over the years with growth in demand.
- **Mutual Funds :** A range of mutual fund schemes are also available for investments. For laymen, they would probably provide better returns with relatively lesser risk. Mutual funds are managed by experienced and skilled fund managers at very low cost. Most funds have outperformed Sensex in India. The funds provide a mix of baskets to choose, such as (i) only debt, (ii) only equity, (iii) a mixture of debt, equity, real estate in a specified proportion, etc.
