# Unit 7 : PC Troubleshooting, Maintenance & Tools

### POST

- **POST : Power-On Self Test**
- The computer POST (power-on self-test) checks a computer's internal hardware for compatibility and connection before starting the remainder of the boot process.
- If the computer passes the POST, the computer may give a single beep (some computers may beep twice) as it starts and continue to boot. However, if the computer fails the POST, the computer will either not beep or generate a beep code that tells the user the source of the problem.
- The principal duties of the main BIOS during POST are as follows:
    - verify CPU registers
    - verify the integrity of the BIOS code itself
    - verify some basic components like DMA, timer, interrupt controller
    - find, size, and verify system main memory
    - initialize BIOS
    - pass control to other specialized extension BIOS (if installed)
    - identify, organize, and select which devices are available for booting

### Preventive Maintenance : Active, Passive, Periodic maintenance procedure

- Preventive maintenance is the key to obtaining years of trouble-free service from your computer system.
- Two types of preventive maintenance are active and passive.
    - An active preventive maintenance program includes procedures that promote a longer,
    trouble-free life for your PC.
    - This type of maintenance primarily involves the periodic cleaning of the system and its components.
    - The active preventive maintenance procedures include cleaning and lubricating all
    major components, resetting chips and connectors, and reformatting harddisks.
    - Tools of Active Preventive Maintenance :
        - Contact cleaning solution
        - A small brush
        - Lint-free foam cleaning swabs
        - Computer vacuum cleaner
        - chemicals
    - An Passive Preventive maintenance includes steps you can take to protect system from the environment such as
        - Using power protection devices
        - Ensuring clean, temperature-controlled environment and
        - Preventing excessive vibration

### Diagnostic Tools

1. **Logic Probe :**
    - A logic probe can be useful for diagnosing problems in digital circuits.
    - In digital circuit signal is represented as either high (+5V) or low (0V). It is used for troubleshooting dead systems.
    - By using the probe, you can determine whether the basic clock circuitry is operating and whether other signals necessary for system operation are present.

2. **Logic Analyzer** 
    - A **Logic analyzer** is an electronic instrument that displays signals in a digital circuit that are too fast to be observed and presents it to a user so that the user can more easily check correct operation of the system.
    - A logic analyzer can trigger on a complicated sequence of digital events, and then capture a large amount of data from the system under test (SUT). The best logical analyzer behave like software debuggers by showing the flow of the computer program and decoding protocols to show message and violations.

### Software Diagnostic Tool

- Diagnosing Windows is not only something IT analysts need to worry about. Anyone who owns a computer should be comfortable using Windows diagnostics tools to do basic troubleshooting.
- Believe it or not, you can fix most problems yourself if you have the right tools available and know how to use them.
1. Process Explorer
- Process Explorer also includes all the following diagnostic features :
    - Real-Time CPU, Memory, I/O and GPU charts
    - Color coding to see most active processes
    - Get detailed properties about processes like memory, priority, handles and more.
    - Customize multiprocessor CPU load and process priority.

  2. CPU ID 

- CPU ID is a powerful tool to view everything you need to know about CPU. It can also help gather GPU or memory card information.
    - Processor brand and all specifications
    - Cache sizes
    - Motherboard brand and version
    - Current memory cards in each slot
    - GPU brand, clock speed and memory
    - CPU benchmarking and stress testing tools.

 3. Wi-fi Analyzer

- It provides the current strength of available Wi-Fi signals. It also shows you a breakdown of details for the network you’re currently connected to. These include the channel, frequency, bandwidth, and more.
- Other features of the free version include:
    - Realtime graph of all local Wi-Fi signals and their strength
    - Filter Wi-Fi graphs based on wireless frequency
    - Bar chart of the strength of all available wireless networks
    - Link speed of your currently connected network
