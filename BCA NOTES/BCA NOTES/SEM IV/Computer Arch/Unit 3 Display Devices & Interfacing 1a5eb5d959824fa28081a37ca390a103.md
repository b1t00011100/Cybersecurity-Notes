### CRT

- **CRT (Cathode Ray Tube)**
    - CRT works by moving an electron beam back and forth across the back of the screen.
    - Green screen was the common name using green “P1”
- Parts of CRT
    - The features of a CRT can be split into 3 main sections. The electron gun, the deflection system and the fluorescent screen
        - **Electron Gun :**
            - The role of this section is to produce electrons at a high, fixed velocity.
            - This is done through a process known as thermionic emission.
            - A filament in the cathode is heated to the point where its electron become loose.
            - An anode with a high voltage applied to it accelerates the electron towards the screen due to electrostatic attraction.
            - On the way, the electrons pass through a series of control grids which control the brightness of the image produced.
            - The more negative the grid, the darker the image and vice versa.
        - **Deflection System**
            - The role of the deflection system is to control the image produced by controlling the position that electrons hit the screen.
            - It consists of Two perpendicular sets of Electric/Magnetic fields.
            - This allows control over the vertical and horizontal axes.
            - By controlling the Voltage applied to the fields, it is possible to vary the deflection through electrostatic force/ Motor effect.
        - **Fluorescent Screen**
            - The role of this part is to display where the electrons are hitting the CRT.
            - It is a screen coated with a material that emits light when struck by electrons.
            - Zinc sulfide or Phosphorus are two commonly used materials.

### Working of CRT Monitor

1. An electron gun consists of a series of electrodes producing a narrow beam of high velocity electrons.
2. When voltage is applied to the heater coil the cathode energizes the electrons and starts the emission of electrons.
3. The intensity of the beam is controlled by variation of the negative potential of the cylindrical control grid surrounding the cathode.
4. The control grid has a hole in the front to allow passage of the electron beam
5. The focus grid adjust its potential to achieve the desired focus. The electrons are accelerated and focused on the fluorescent screen In order to eliminate flicker, most monitors refresh the screen at a 60 Hz rate.

### Characteristics of CRT Monitor

- **Pixel or Picture element :** It is the smallest area of the monitor screen that can be turned on or off to help create an image.
- **Dot pitch :** Measurement of how close the holes are to each other. The closer the holes, the smaller is the dot pitch and sharper is the image.
- **Resolution :** Amount of detail a monitor can show. It is expressed in terms of number of horizontal and vertical pixels contained on the screen.
- **Video Bandwidth :** It is the maximum input frequency that a monitor can handle. It helps in determining the resolution capability of the monitor.
- **Horizontal Scanning Frequency :** Frequency at which monitor redraws the horizontal lines that make the image. For VGA monitor - 31.5 KHz For SVGA monitor - 35 to 48 KHz.
- **Vertical Scanning Frequency :** (Vertical Refresh Rate) (Frame Rate) Frequency at which hole screen is redrawn. Higher the refresh rate , Lesser the flicker.
- **Interlaced scanning :** A interlace display draws an image as two passes. Once the first pass is complete a second pass fills in the rest of image. (Full explanation in Textbook).
- **Non Interlaced scanning :** A non interlaced monitor draws all of the lines that compose an image in one pass.
- Difference between :

| **Interlaced Scanning** | **Non Interlaced Scanning** |
| --- | --- |
| Scan every other line of image in one pass & remaining line in other pass  | Scan all lines in one pass |
| Difficult on eyes | easy on eyes |
| Flicker is more | Flicker is less |
| Effective image refresh rate is half of vertical scanning rate | Entire image is refresh at vertical scanning rate |

### LCD

- A Liquid crystal display or LCD draws definition from name itself.
- It is combination of two states of matter, the solid and the liquid. LCD uses a liquid crystal to produce a visible image.
- LCD’s technologies allow display to be much thinner when compared to cathode ray tube tech.
- Liquid crystal display is composed of several layers which include two polarized panel filters and electrodes.
- Light is projected from a lens on a layer of liquid crystal. This combination of colored light with the grayscale image of the crystal (formed as electric current flows through the crystal) forms the colored image. This image is then displayed on the screen.
- Liquid crystal display screen works on the principle of blocking light rather than emitting light. LCD’s requires backlight as they do not emits light by them. We always use devices which are made up of LCD’s displays which are replacing the use of cathode ray tube. Cathode ray tube draws more power compared to LCD’s and are also heavier and bigger.

### Construction of LCD

![lcd.PNG](Unit%203%20Display%20Devices%20&%20Interfacing/lcd.png)

1. The basic structure of LCD should be controlled by changing the applied current.
2. We must use a polarized light.
3. Liquid crystal should able be to control both of the operation to transmit or can also able to
change the polarized light.

### Working of LCD

- The principle behind the LCD’s is that when an electrical current is applied to the liquid crystal molecule, the molecule tends to untwist.
- This causes the angle of light which is passing through the molecule of the polarized glass and also cause a change in the angle of the top polarizing filter.
- As a result a little light is allowed to pass the polarized glass through a particular area of the LCD. Thus that particular area will become dark compared to other.
- The LCD works on the principle of blocking light.
- While constructing the LCD’s, a reflected mirror is arranged at the back. An electrode plane is made of indium-tin oxide which is kept on top and a polarized glass with a polarizing film is also added on the bottom of the device. The complete region of the LCD has to be enclosed by a common electrode and above it should be the liquid crystal matter.
- Next comes to the second piece of glass with an electrode in the form of the rectangle on the bottom and, on top, another polarizing film.
- It must be considered that both the pieces are kept at right angles. When there is no current, the light passes through the front of the LCD it will be reflected by the mirror and bounced back.
- As the electrode is connected to a battery the current from it will cause the liquid crystals between the common-plane electrode and the electrode shaped like a rectangle to untwist. Thus the light is blocked from passing through. That particular rectangular area appears blank.

### Touch Screen Display

- The touch sensor is a panel, usually made of glass that has a touch responsive surface.
- Different touch screens are built based on different types of sensors. The most common sensors are resistive, capacitive, and acoustic wave sensors.
- In general, sensors function with an electrical current running through them. Touching the screen causes a voltage change,
which signals the location of the touch.

### Plasma Display Panel

- A plasma display panel (PDP) is a type of flat panel display often used for large television displays (typically above 37 inches or 940 millimeters (mm)).
- Many tiny cells located between two panels of glass hold an inert mixture of noble gases (neon and xenon). The gas in the cells is electrically turned into a plasma, which then excites phosphors to emit light.
- Plasma display technology offers the advantages of producing displays with large, very thin screens and bright images with wide viewing angles. With the advent of "seamless" plasma display technology, it has become possible to display more than one image on the video wall simultaneously, to adjust color balance, and to switch between contents from multiple inputs in the video wall.
