# Unit 6 : Interfaces

### SCSI

- **SCSI** is Small Computer systems interface.
- Its high speed standard for physically connecting & transferring data between computers and peripheral devices.
- It is very high speed parallel / serial interface, which is used to connect up to 7 devices to the computer system using only one interface card.
- SCSI is basically bus into which different peripherals are connected in a daisy chain.
- There are 3 different SCSI standards : SCSI 1, SCSI 2, SCSI 3
- Features of SCSI 1
    - 8-bit parallel bus
    - 5 MHz asynchronous and synchronous operation
    - 50 pin cable
    - Passive termination
    - Optimal bus party
- Features of SCSI 2
    - Fast SCSI (10MHz)
    - Wide SCSI (16 bit transfers)
    - New commands
    - High density, 50 pin cable connectors
- Features of SCSI 3
    - Ultra 2 SCSI
    - Ultra 3 SCSI
    - Ultra 4 SCSI
    - Ultra 5 SCSI
    - New low Voltage differential signaling
    - Elimination of high voltage differential signaling
- **SCSI Drive Configuration**
    - Configuring the SCSI drive is a bit critical than configuring the IDE.
    - Following parameters must be set before configuring the SCSI drive
        - SCSI Device ID
        - Termination Activate
        - Disable Auto Start
        - Delay Auto Start
        - Staggers pin
        - Narrow / wide
        - Force SE
        - Disable Parity

### USB (Universal Serial Bus)

- It is a serial bus standard to connect devices or interface devices.
- Improves plug & play facilities.
- Allows Hot Swapping:(No need to reboot the system.)
- Consumes low power, does not require external power supply.
- USB can connect computer peripherals such as mouse, devices, keyboards , PDAs,
game pads, scanners, digital cameras, Printers etc.
- The design of USB is standardized by the USB Implementers forum (USB-IF).It is an industry standards body incorporating leading companies from Computer & electronics industries.
