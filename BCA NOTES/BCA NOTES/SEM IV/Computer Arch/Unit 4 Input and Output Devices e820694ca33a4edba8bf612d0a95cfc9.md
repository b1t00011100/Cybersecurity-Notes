# Unit 4 : Input and Output Devices

### Keyboard

- Keyboard is the most common and very popular input device which uses to input text data to the computer.
- The layout of the keyboard is like that of traditional typewriter, although there are some additional keys provided for performing additional functions.
- The basic functionality of the PC keyboard has changed little in the almost 20 years since the release of the original IBM PC.
- The number of keys increased 83 to 101 and now there is 104 and most of keyboard manufacturers provide special faction keys like multimedia functionality.
- **Keyboard Layouts :**
    - 83 Key PC/AT keyboard
    - 84-key AT keyboard
    - Enhance 101-key keyboard
    - Windows 104-key keyboard
- PC keyboard connects to the motherboard on the computer using different connector.
- Wired keyboards connect to the motherboard via a USB cable, using the USB Type A connector.
- Older keyboards connect via a 5-pin DIN connector which is use to connect motherboard that use Baby-AT form factor.
- The 6-pin mini DIN connector also called PS/2 connector.
- Keyboards on laptops are of course integrated, but technically would be considered "wired" since that's how they are connected to the computer.
- Now days many keyboards are wireless, communicating with the computer via Bluetooth or an RF receiver.
- **Types of Switches Keyboard**
    - **Mechanical Switch Keyboard -** These keyboards use standard spring-loaded momentary-on switches.
        - Pressing a key compresses a spring and causes a plunger on the bottom of the key to make physical contact to close the connection.
        - When the key is released, the spring forces it back into rest position.
    - **Capacitive Keyboard -** These keyboards are unique in that pressing a key does not make electrical contact to complete the circuit board.
        - Instead, movement of the plunger on the bottom of a key alters the state of a capacitive circuit, which keyboard controller recognized as a key press.
        - Keyboards with capacitive switches provide clacky feedback, are even more durable than mechanical keyboard.
    - **Membrane Keyboard -** Most current keyboards use membrane switches. Unlike mechanical and capacitive keyboards, which use discrete physical switches for each key and are correspondingly expensive to produce, a membrane keyboard combines all key switches into one unit comprising three membrane layers.
        - The bottom layer has printed conductive traces that correspond to the individual key switches.
        - The middle layer is a spacer, with holes that expose each underlying layer.
        - The top layer is an array of rubber domes, against each of which the bottom of a key impinges.
        - When a key is pressed, it forces the conductive bottom of the rubber dome through the spacing layer and into contact with the switch traces on the bottom layer, completing the circuit. When the key is released, the rubber dome forces it back into rest position.
    - **Dome-switch Keyboard -** There’s also a hybrid type that combines elements from the category of flat-panel membrane or mechanical switch, known as Dome-switch.
        - It uses two circuit board traces under a flexible keypad using either metal or polyurethane formed dome. They bring two circuit board traces together under a rubber or silicone keypad using either metal “dome” switches or polyurethane formed dome.

### Mouse

- Mouse was not part of original PC configuration till the Graphical User Interface (GUI) had not been introduced.
- But in mouse became essential input device as keyboard. Mouse is the most popular pointing device.
- It is a very famous cursor-control device having a small palm size box with a round ball at its base, which senses the movement of the mouse and sends corresponding signals to the CPU when the mouse buttons are pressed.
- The optical mouse is a computer mouse first introduced by Microsoft on April 19, 1999, that utilizes LEDs (light-emitting diodes) or a laser to track movement.
- **Types of mouse :**
    - **Mechanical Mouse -** The ball mouse was the first type of mouse created and this device is integrated with a metal or a rubber ball.
        - The ball mouse has two freely rotating rollers. These are located 90degrees apart.
        - One roller detects the forward-backward motion of the mouse and other the left-right  movement.
        - The biggest drawback in a mechanical mouse is the regular cleaning they will require due to the accumulation of dirt which will hinder with the cursor movement.
    - **Opto-mechanical Mouse -** Alternatively referred as the ball mouse, the optical-mechanical mouse consists of a ball that rolls one of two wheels inside the mouse.
        - Each wheel contains a circle of holes or notches, an LED light through and be detected by the sensor. As the wheel rotates these lights represent X-axis and Y-axis for the mouse pointer on your screen.
        - This mouse is more accurate than a mechanical mouse that uses only wheels and rollers. however, is not as good as an optical mouse.
    - **Optical Mouse -** Optical mouse uses a different method for determining the position of the cursor. Early optical mouse used an infrared LED to detect the movement of the mouse pad, rather relying on the traction between the mouse ball and the rollers.
        - While this type of mouse was more accurate than an optical mechanical mouse, and avoided the maintenance problems associated with the moving parts of an optical mechanical mouse, it did have its drawbacks.
        - The most obvious was reliance on a special grid-patterned mouse pad. Another was that performance could be compromised by bright lights.

### Scanner

- Scanner is an input device that scans physical documents such as photographs and pages of text.
- When a document is scanned, it is converted to digital format.
- This creates a digital version of the document that can be viewed and edited using computer.
- Some scanners are flat scanning surface called as flat-bed scanner.
    - This is ideal for photographs, magazines and various documents.

- A flatbed scanner is made up of a glass pane and a moving optical CIS or CCD array.
- Contact Image Sensors (CIS) are image sensors used in flatbed scanners almost in direct contact with the object to be scanned.
- Charge-coupled devices, often used for this application they use mirrors to bounce off light to a stationary sensor.
- The pane is illuminated with the help of bright light planted below it. The sensor and source of light move across the glass pane to scan the document and produce its digital copy.
- The optic information from a scanner sensor is turned into digital pixel information in
order to be saved as a digital file, such as a JPG, PNG or TIFF.
- Another type of scanner is a sheet-feed scanner.
    - which can only accept single paper documents at one time.
    - While sheet-feed scanners cannot scan books, some models include an automatic document feeder, which allows multiple pages to be scanned in sequence.
    - In this type of scanner, the document is feed into the horizontal or vertical slot provided in it.
    - The prominent components of a sheet fed scanner include the sheet-feeder, scanning module, and calibration sheet.
    - While the sensor and source of light move across the glass pane in flatbed scanners, in sheet fed scanners, they are stationary.
    - Instead, the document moves through the scanner. Ideal for scanning single page documents, these scanners cannot scan thick objects, like books, and that, perhaps, is their major drawback.
- **Handheld Scanner -** A handheld scanner is a small manual scanning device which is moved over the object that needs to be scanned.
    - Using a handheld scanner can be a cumbersome task as the hand needs to be steady all the time. Even a slight movement of hand can lead to distortion of the image.
    - One of the most-utilized handheld scanners is the barcode scanner, typically used in shopping stores to valuate goods.
- **OCR -** Optical character recognition
    - OCR (optical character recognition) is the use of technology to distinguish printed or handwritten text characters inside digital images of physical documents, such as a scanned paper document.
    - The basic process of OCR involves examining the text of a document and translating the characters into code that can be used for data processing. OCR is sometimes also referred to as text recognition.
    - OCR systems are made up of a combination of hardware and software that is used to convert physical documents into digital format.
    - Optical scanner or specialized circuit board is used to copy or read text while software typically handles the advanced processing.
    - Software can also take advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) to implement more advanced methods of intelligent character recognition (ICR), like
    identifying languages or styles of handwriting.
