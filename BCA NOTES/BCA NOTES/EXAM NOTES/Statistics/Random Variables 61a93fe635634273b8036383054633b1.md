# Random Variables

- Denoted by capital letter (X)
- Value taken by the variable is usually denoted by small letters
- Values with different probabilities are called as **discrete random variable.**
- A Discrete random variable can assume either a finite or countably infinite number of values.
- Discrete - Finite
- **Random continuous Variable** can assume all intervals (finite or infinite).
- Variable which are neither discrete nor continuous are called **Mixed Random Variables.**
