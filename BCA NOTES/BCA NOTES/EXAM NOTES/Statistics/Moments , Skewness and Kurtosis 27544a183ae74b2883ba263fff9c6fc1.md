# Moments , Skewness and Kurtosis

## Symmetrical Distribution

- A Frequency Distribution is said to be symmetrical if the frequency on both sides of the central value (Mean) are equally distributed.
- A Symmetrical Distribution may be U-Shaped or Bell Shaped.
- In Symmetrical Distribution mean=mode=median.

## Skewed Distribution

- Skewness is used to measure asymmetry in our data. It is the measure of asymmetry that occurs when our data deviates from the norm.

### Types of Skewed Distribution

- Positively Skewed
    - In this Distribution Data is Skewed to the right
    - Mean> Mode and Median
- Negatively Skewed
    - In this Distribution Data is skewed to the left
    - Mode>Mean and Median

### Graphical Measure of Skewness

- Measures of skewness helps us to know to what degree and in which direction (Positive or Negative) the frequency distribution has a departure from Symmetry.
- Positive or Negative skewness can be detected graphically depending on whether right tail or left tali is longer but , we don’t get the idea of magnitude

## Pearson’s coefficient of Skewness

- This method is most frequently used for measuring skewness.
- The formula for measuring coefficient of skewness is given by :
    
    Pearson’s Coefficient = mean - mode / Standard Deviation
    
- In case where the mode is indeterminate :
    
    Pearson’s Coefficient = Mean - (3 Median - 2 Mean) / Standard Deviation.

    💡 Note -
    
    - When the Pearson’s Coefficient is between  -0.5 - 0.5 . the data is symmetrical,

## Kurtosis

- **Kurtosis** is **a measure of the tailedness of a distribution**. Tailedness is how often outliers occur.
- Kurtosis is another measure of the shape of a frequency curve.
- While Skewness signifies the extent of asymmetry , Kurtosis measures the degree of peakness of a frequency Distribution.

- When the peak of a curve becomes relatively high then the curve is called **Leptokurtic (Kurt > 0).**
- When the curve is flat topped , it is called **Platykurtic (Kurt < 0).**
- The normal curve is called **Mesokurtic (Kurt = 0).**
