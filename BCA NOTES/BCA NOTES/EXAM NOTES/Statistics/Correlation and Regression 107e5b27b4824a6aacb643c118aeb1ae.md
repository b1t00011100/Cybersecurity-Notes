# Correlation and Regression

### Correlation

- Definition : Degree to which 2 variables are related
- Correlation lies between -1 to 1
- For Example : Demand and Price
- Positive Correlation : if 1 up 2nd goes up too in the same direction
- Negative Correlation : Inverse Relationship between 2 variables
- Coefficient of Correlation (r) : Strength of linear relationship between 2 variables
- IF -1 STRONG NEGATIVE , BETWEEN -1 AND 0 IS NEGATIVE
- IF 0 THERE IS NO RELATION
- IF 1 STRONG POSITIVE , BETWEEN 1 AND 0 IS POSITIVE

### Limitations of Correlation

- It does not tell us everything about the data ,mean and sd still important
- if the data has no straight line , we cannot precisely state the value of r

### Calculate Correlation

- Pearson’s Coefficient : is the test statistic that measures the statistical relationship between two variables.
    - OUTPUT : Correlation, magnitude of association and direction
- Spearman’s Rank Coefficient : is used to measure the strength of a link between two sets of data.

### Regression

- Regression Analysis : is the mathematical measure to calculate average relationship between two or more variables.
    - is used to denote estimation or prediction of average value of one variable for a specified value of other variable
- Types :
    - Independent Variable : is used for prediction and also influences the value and also called predictor variable.
    - Dependent Variable (y) : is to be predicted or influenced and it is also called predicted variable.
