# Graph

Definition

<aside>
💡 *A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph*.

## Components of Graph

- **Vertices:** Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes. Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.
- **Edges:** Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labeled/unlabelled.
- **Path**: Edges between two Nodes.
- **Adjacent Nodes**: Two nodes are called Adjacent if they are connected through an edge.
- **Directed-Graph**: A directed graph is one where the edges can be traversed in specific direction only.
- **Weight**: Weight is one where the edges have given a value.
- **Length**: Number of edges connected to that node.

## Representation of Graph

- **Adjacency matrix**: Graph in 2-D Array.
- **Adjacency lists**: Graph in Linked lists.
