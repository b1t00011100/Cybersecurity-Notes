# Tree

## Definition

<aside>
💡 A **tree data structure** is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search.

</aside>

*The topmost node of the tree is called the root, and the nodes below it are called the child nodes. Each node can have multiple child nodes, and these child nodes can also have their own child nodes, forming a recursive structure*

## Terminology of Tree Data Structure

- **Parent Node**- Predecessor of root node.
- **Child Node**- immediate successor of that Node.
- **Root Node**- Topmost Node.
- **Siblings**- Children of the same parent.
- **Level of a Node** - The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node, e.g Root node is at 0 level
- **Neighbour of a node**- Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node.

## Properties of Tree Data Structure

- **Number of edges**- An edge can be defined as connection between nodes.
- **Depth of a Node**- Distance/path from root to that node is the depth of that node
- **Height of a node:** The height of a node can be defined as the length of the longest path from the node to a leaf node of the tree.
- **Height of the Tree:** The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root of the tree to a leaf node of the tree.
- **Degree of a Node-** The total count of sub-trees attached to that node is the degree of that node**.**

### Binary Tree

<aside>
💡 **Binary Tree** is defined as a tree data structure where each node has at most 2 children. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

## Binary Search Tree

**Binary Search Tree** is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

- The left sub-tree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
- The right sub-tree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
- The left and right sub-tree each must also be a binary search tree.

## Traversal of Binary Tree

**The Traversal of a Binary tree is to visit each node exactly once**.

There are three Orders in which this executes:

1. Pre-Order : ROOT - LEFT SUB-TREE - RIGHT SUB-TREE
2. In-Order : LEFT SUBTREE - ROOT - RIGHT SUB-TREE
3. Post-Order : LEFT SUB-TREE - RIGHT SUB-TREE - ROOT

preorder : 5 3 2 4 7 6 8
