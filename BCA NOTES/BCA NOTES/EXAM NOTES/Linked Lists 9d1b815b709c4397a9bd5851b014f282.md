# Linked Lists

## Introduction

<aside>
💡 Linked list is a Linear Data Structure, In which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory Locations.

</aside>

## Basic Explanation

1. Memory in Array List is contiguous
2. When an element is to added in middle of a list, Linked List Data Structure is used for better time complexity i.e O(1)
3. When there are Manipulative(Insertion) Operations Linked List is used, but Where Search Operations are to be executed Array List are better.
4. In the previous point, We use the peculiar Data Structure for Optimized Time Complexity.

## Properties Of LINKED LISTS

- Variable Size - There is no Fixed Size, it is very Dynamic. Elements can be easily Manipulated.
- Non-contiguous Memory - There are chunks of Data which can be Linked.
- Time Complexity of insert - O(1)
- Time Complexity of search - O(n)

## Basic Structure of LINKED LIST

<aside>
💡 Chunks of Data in Linked list which are linked are called Nodes.

</aside>

- First Node is called a HEAD and the Last Node is called NULL node.

> There are two components in a Single Node
> 
- Data - Elements Stored.
- Next - Address of Next Node.

## Types of LINKED LIST

1. Singular List - Basic Linked List.
2. Double List - Linked list in which u can traverse reverse.
3. Circular List - This Linked List does not have a NULL node in the end and the first and Last are Linked.
