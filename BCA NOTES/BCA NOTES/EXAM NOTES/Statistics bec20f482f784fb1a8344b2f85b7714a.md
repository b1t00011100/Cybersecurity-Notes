# Statistics

## **Classification and Tabulation**

- Textual Representation - Described In Paragraphs.
- Tabular Representation - Statistical Data.
- Statistical Data - Data presented in :
    - One-way Table
    - Two-way Table
    - Three-way Table

<aside>
💡 Definition of Frequency : The number of observations is called the frequency of that class

</aside>

## Equations

- Relative Frequency = f/N (f-Frequency of that Class, N- Total Frequency)
- % Relative Frequency = f/N*100 (f-Frequency of that Class, N- Total Frequency)
- Density Frequency = f/h (f-frequency of that class , h - class width)

# Central Tendency

<aside>
💡 **Mean:** The "average" number; found by adding all data points and dividing by the number of data points.

<aside>
💡 **Median**: is the middle point in a dataset—half of the data points are smaller than the median and half of the data points are larger.
